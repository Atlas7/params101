My attempt to work throug the Rails Params101 tutorial at [this blog by Daniel P. Clark](http://6ftdan.com/allyourdev/2014/08/01/manual-polymorphic-creation-in-rails/).

Instruction:

Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Atlas7/params101.git
```

Navigate in the `params101` foler.

Start a local rails server:

```
rails s
```

Go to [http://localhost:3000/profiles/new](http://localhost:3000/profiles/new).

Notice the error - is there a bug somewhere?
